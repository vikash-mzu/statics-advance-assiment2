    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "•\tProbability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to a specific value.\n",
    "o\tExample: If we roll a die, the PMF for rolling a 4 would be P(X=4)=1/6P(X=4) = 1/6P(X=4)=1/6.\n",
    "•\tProbability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables. It gives the likelihood of the variable falling within a particular range of values, rather than at any specific point.\n",
    "o\tExample: If we model the heights of people in a population, we use a PDF to calculate the probability that someone's height falls between two values, say 160 cm and 170 cm.\n",

    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why is CDF used?\n",
    "•\tCumulative Density Function (CDF) describes the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a particular value. It is the cumulative sum of the probabilities for all values up to that point.\n",
    "o\tExample: For a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, the CDF at X=1X = 1X=1 represents the probability that a randomly selected value from the distribution will be less than or equal to 1.\n",
    "•\tWhy is CDF used? CDFs are useful for understanding the probability of a value falling below a threshold and can help in comparing distributions or calculating probabilities for ranges of values.\n",

    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "•\tExamples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "o\tHeights of people.\n",
    "o\tScores on a standardized test like SAT or GRE.\n",
    "o\tMeasurement errors in experiments.\n",
    "•\tParameters of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "o\tMean (μ\\muμ): Determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "o\tStandard Deviation (σ\\sigmaσ): Determines the spread or width of the distribution. A smaller σ\\sigmaσ results in a narrower curve, while a larger σ\\sigmaσ results in a wider curve.\n",
    "The normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, and the spread is controlled by the standard deviation. Most of the data lies within 1 or 2 standard deviations from the mean.\n",

    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "The Normal Distribution is important because it describes many natural phenomena and is the foundation of various statistical methods, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Many real-world datasets follow a normal distribution, which makes it easier to apply statistical models and make predictions.\n",
    "•\tReal-life examples:\n",

    "Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "•\tBernoulli Distribution: A distribution representing two possible outcomes (success or failure) in a single trial, with probability ppp for success and 1−p1-p1−p for failure.\n",
    "o\tExample: Flipping a coin once (success = heads, failure = tails).\n",
    "•\tDifference between Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions:\n",
    "o\tBernoulli Distribution: Represents a single trial.\n",
    "o\tBinomial Distribution: Represents the number of successes in nnn independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

    "Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "•\tTo calculate the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60, we need to find the z-score and use the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "Z=X−μσ=60−5010=1Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1Z=σX−μ=1060−50=1\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table, the probability of Z≤1Z \\leq 1Z≤1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected observation is greater than 60 is:\n",
    "P(X>60)=1−P(Z≤1)=1−0.8413=0.1587P(X > 60) = 1 - P(Z \\leq 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587P(X>60)=1−P(Z≤1)=1−0.8413=0.1587\n",

    "Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "•\tUniform Distribution is a type of distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely within a given range.\n",

    "Q8: What is the z-score? State the importance of the z-score.\n",
    "•\tZ-score: A z-score represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is used to standardize scores on different scales to a common scale (the standard normal distribution).\n",
    "•\tImportance: Z-scores allow comparison of data points from different distributions and help in identifying outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem (CLT)? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "•\tCentral Limit Theorem (CLT): States that the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the distribution of the population, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "•\tSignificance: CLT allows for the use of normal distribution in inferential statistics, even when the population distribution is not normal. It is the basis for many statistical procedures like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
